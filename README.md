####Title
BEGINNER PYTHONISTAS: SETTING UP YOUR WORKSPACE (LIFE PRE-PYTHON)

####Location
12:15 PM - 12:40 PM on July 17, 2016, Room CR7

####Audience level
Novice

####Description
Learn to work more efficiently. If you're new to Unix and Markdown, this session will help you save time on all the peripheral tasks so you can spend more time on Python.

####Abstract
In this talk, I will share 5 examples of 5 different topics that were at one time foreign to me. The goal of presenting 5 is enough to get you started, and you can explore more on your own. I will do a quick example of how to create a markdown file on GitHub and view it live. I will show how to set up your bash profile with 5 shortcuts so you can avoid unnecessary typing when navigating through your directories. I'll share my 5 most commonly used GREP commands, 5 keystroke shortcuts that work in almost any editor and 5 of my favorite bash commands.

####Bonus
How to add an emoji to your bash prompt
