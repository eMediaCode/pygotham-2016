Abstract:
In this talk, I will share 5 examples of 5 different topics that were at one time foreign to me.  The goal of presenting 5 is enough to get you started, and you can explore more on your own.  I will do a quick example of how to create a markdown file on GitHub and view it live.  I will show how to set up your bash profile with 5 shortcuts so you can avoid unnecessary typing when navigating through your directories.  I'll share my 5 most commonly used GREP commands, 5 keystroke shortcuts that work in almost any editor and 5 of my favorite bash programs.  


Outline:
Learn beginning steps for the following:
* Markdown files - the basics
* setting up bash_profile (and aliases (aka shortcuts) to save you time)
* GREP search command
* editor shortcuts
* Use bash commands (tree, comparing two files, Unix commands)



* launching Sublime text from your shell prompt
